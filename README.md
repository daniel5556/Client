barebones-client
================

An OldSchool RuneScape client without the bells and whistles.

The default world is 327 (my home world), but you can currently set it to whatever
you want (including the bot worlds 385 and 386) by making a shortcut to the executable, right-clicking
into Properties, and appending the world number in the Target field.
Example: If you wanted to set it to 330, and the executable was in your Downloads
directory, you'd make sure the Target field for your shortcut looks like this:
```
"C:\Users\You\Downloads\OldSchool RuneScape.exe" 330
```

You may also pass world numbers in a more casual notation, like so:
```
"C:\Users\You\Downloads\OldSchool RuneScape.exe" 30
```

You can make it load into any world you'd like just for the session by passing the world number as an argument
into your Terminal (cmd or Powershell for Windows users):
```
"OldSchool RuneScape.exe" 330
```
